picomdnsd

picodnsd is a tiny mdns server that allows mapping arbitrary hostnames
to arbitrary IPV4, both provided on the command line, using multicast DNS.

picodnsd <hostname> <ip>

It takes no other inputs, or configuration. It can currently only make
one mapping. 

It does not deamonize itself, so that is left as an exercise to the user
